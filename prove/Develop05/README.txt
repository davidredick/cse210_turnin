EternalQuest README
===================

Welcome, brave goal-getter, to EternalQuest – your ultimate (and slightly cheeky) goal-tracking adventure! 
This isn’t your grandma’s checklist; it’s a full-on quest manager that tracks your progress, moves completed goals 
to a special “completed” list (like sending off those dreams to graduation), and even throws in some random inspirational quotes 
to keep you pumped. (We promise, 55% funny with a dash of sarcasm!)

How It Works
------------
• **Creating Goals:**  
   You’ll first choose your goal’s term (Short, Middle, Long, or Eternal) and then whether your progress will be tracked 
   via ticks or as a percentage. Enter your goal name and then the specifics (ticks required, bonus ticks, or initial percentage).

• **Logging Progress:**  
   Simply choose the “Log Process” option, pick a goal, and update your progress. For tick-based goals, each tick counts 
   toward your target; for percentage-based goals, simply enter a new percentage (progress cannot go backwards, because time is money).

• **Automatic Graduation:**  
   Once a goal reaches its target (100% for percentage goals or the required tick count for checklist goals), it is automatically 
   moved to the “completed” list. Consider it your digital graduation ceremony – cap and gown not included.

• **Saving & Loading:**  
   All goals are saved to disk (both active and completed), so you can rest easy knowing your progress is stored for future adventures.


Final Thoughts
--------------
EternalQuest is here to help you track your goals, motivate you with witty comments, and ensure that your achievements 
are celebrated (and archived) properly. Now, saddle up, and get ready to conquer your dreams – one tick (or percentage point) 
at a time.

Happy goal-tracking!
